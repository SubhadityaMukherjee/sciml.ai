# Next Directions: Google Summer of Code

The next directions are going to be highly tied to the directions that
we are going with the latest Google Summer of Code, so here are a few
things to look forward to:

- Some tooling for automated training of physics-informed neural
  networks (PINNs) from ModelingToolkit symbolic descriptions of the
  PDE.
- Efficiency enhancements to native Julia BDF methods.
- More Lie Group integrator methods.
- Higher efficiency low-storage Runge-Kutta methods with a demonstration
  of optimality in a large-scale climate model (!!!).
- More high weak order methods for SDEs
- Causal components in ModelingToolkit

And many many more. There will be enough that I don't think we will
wait a whole month for the next update, so see you soon!
